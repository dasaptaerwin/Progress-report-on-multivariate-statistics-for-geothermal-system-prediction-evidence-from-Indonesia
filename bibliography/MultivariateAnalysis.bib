	abstract = {Numerous hot springs and fumaroles occur along the Andes Mountains, in the Bolivian Altiplano, where people use thermal springs for recreational purposes as pools, baths and also for consumption as drinking water and irrigation once it is mixed with natural surface waters; most of these thermal springs emerge from earth surface and flow naturally into the rivers streams which drain further into the Poopó Lake. Physicochemical characteristics of the thermal water samples showed pH from 6.3 to 8.3 with an average of 7.0, redox potential from+106 to+204mV with an average of+172mV, temperatures from 40 to 75°C with an average of 56°C and high electrical conductivity ranging from 1.8 to 75mS/cm and averaged 13mS/cm. Predominant major ions are Na+ and Cl- and the principal water types are 37.5\% Na-Cl type and 37.5\% Na-Cl-HCO3 type. Arsenic concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 65.3μg/L and arsenic speciation indicate the predominance of As(III) species. Sediments collected from the outlets of thermal waters show high iron content, and ferric oxides and hydroxides are assumed to be principal mineral phases for arsenic attenuation by adsorption/co-precipitation processes. Arsenic concentrations in cold water samples from shallow aquifers are higher than those in thermal springs (range\&lt;5.6-233.2μg/L), it is likely that thermal water discharge is not the main source of high arsenic content in the shallow aquifer as they are very immature and may only have a small component corresponding to the deep geothermal reservoir. As people use both thermal waters and cold waters for consumption, there is a high risk for arsenic exposure in the area. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {A literature review has been composed to look for potential future topics and approaches in geochemical application in geothermal exploration, using online databases: Google Scholar, Scopus, and GRC library. Three sets of search terms have been used in the search. As many as 298 relevant documents in form of conference abstracts, proceedings, and journal papers have been selected from a total of 522 documents of geothermal of Indonesia, using the following criteria: the availability of pdf, full paper, and data set. Based on the evaluation, we can draw some points. Geochemical has been used in Kamojang field to identify geothermal system since 1975. Since then many published works were working on the fluid behaviour and geotermometry. Kamojang field were the most published geothermal site in Indonesia 65 papers, followed by Darajat field, 36 papers and Karaha field, 31 papers. Compared to other geothermal-rich countries, geothermal publications in Indonesia is still low, due to the high confidentiality of the data set. Increasing the number of open data could increase the number of scholarly works, that at the end could add some new knowledge about the system. We propose the following terms as the future topics: Boron, Lithium, and Mercury (and other trace elements) cycle, stable isotope, and rare earth elements (REE). We also recommend to maximize the use of multivariate statistics (cluster, PCA, multiple regression, RandomForest). Utilization of open source apps, eg: R, Python, Orange Data Mining, is also part of our recommendation.},

	abstract = {Currently, risk assessments related to rising sea levels and the adoption of defensive or adaptive measures to counter these sea level increases are underway for densely populated deltas where economic losses might be important, especially in the developed world. However, many underpopulated deltas harbouring high biological and cultural diversity are also at risk but will most likely continue to be ignored as conservation targets. In this study, we explore the potential effects of erosion, inundation and salinisation on one of the world's comparatively underpopulated megadeltas, the Orinoco Delta. With a 1. m sea level rise expected to occur by 2100, several models predict a moderate erosion of the delta's shorelines, migration or loss of mangroves, general inundation of the delta with an accompanying submersion of wetlands, and an increase in the distance to which sea water intrudes into streams, resulting in harm to the freshwater biota and resources. The Warao people are the indigenous inhabitants of the Orinoco Delta and currently are subject to various socioeconomic stressors. Changes due to sea level rise will occur extremely rapidly and cause abrupt shifts in the Warao's traditional environments and resources, resulting in migrations and abandonment of their ancestral territories. However, evidence indicates that deltaic aggradation/accretion processes at the Orinoco delta due to allochthonous sediment input and vegetation growth could be elevating the surface of the land, keeping pace with the local sea level rise. Other underpopulated and large deltas of the world also may risk immeasurable biodiversity and cultural losses and should not be forgotten as important conservation targets. © 2015.},

	abstract = {The following provides a brief introduction to generalized additive
models and some thoughts on getting started within the R environment.
It doesn’t assume much more than a basic exposure to regression,
and maybe a general idea of R though not necessarily any particular
expertise. The presentation is of a very applied nature, and such
that the topics build upon the familiar and generalize to the less so,
with the hope that one can bring the concepts they are comfortable
with to the new material. The audience in mind is a researcher with
typical social science training, though is not specific to those disciplines
alone.
To familiarize yourself with R, I have an introduction to R here
and second part here, and they would provide all one would need for
the following, though there is much to be gained from simple web
browsing on R. And while it wasn’t the intention starting out, this
document could be seen as a vignette for the mgcv package.
With regard to the text, functions are in red text, packages in blue,
and links are sort of orange. With regard to the graphs, they are meant
to be zoomed in upon, and you can do so without loss of clarity. Having
them smaller and in the margins allows the reader to focus on
them as much or little as you like as one would like while having them
right where they need to be in relation to the text (for the most part).
If using Adobe reader, I usually have to turn off ’enhance thin lines’
in preferences in order to see the graphs as they are originally constructed,
but other readers should be fine.

	abstract = {Groundwater is the major source to meet domestic, industrial and agricultural needs in the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. However, population growth, increasing urbanization, industrialization and tourism, and climatic changes have caused an intensive exploitation of groundwater resources leading the aquifers become more vulnerable to seawater intrusion. The aim of this study is to examine the variations of groundwater chemistry (as resulting from natural and anthropogenic inputs) depending on seasonal changes, in order to evaluate water quality for drinking and irrigation purposes. Physical and chemical data come from the analysis of groundwater samples, collected from 72 wells, used for the evaluation of water quality parameters, during a year of monitoring. Pattern diagrams, geochemical modeling techniques and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) have been used to identify the main factors influencing groundwater composition. Based on the hydrochemistry, the groundwater was classified into three types: (a) Na-Cl, (b) Ca-Cl, (c) mixed Ca-Na-HCO3-Cl (d) mixed Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4. The geochemical modeling results show that groundwater chemistry is mainly influenced by evaporation process, as it is suggested by the increase of Na and Cl ions concentrations. According to irrigation water quality assessment diagrams of USDA, most water samples from dry and rainy seasons, distributed in category C2-S1, C3-S1, C3-S2, C4-S2 highlighting medium to very high salinity hazard and low to medium sodium content class. PCA evidenced the role of seawater intrusion, evaporation process and anthropogenic pollution (i.e. high NO3 levels due to agricultural activities), as the major factors that influenced the water chemistry, and hence the water quality. Based on Pearson correlation matrix, the presence of high correlations (\&gt;0.8) among Na, Cl, Mg and SO4, in association with EC, were interpreted as the seawater intrusion effects. In this area groundwater quality is generally low, and often exceeds permissible limits of standard guideline values of WHO and FAO, referred to EC and chloride values. The high salinity and the groundwater level depletion create serious problems for current use of water supplies as well as future exploitation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Metolachlor enantiomer fractions of 0.494. ±. 0.009 in the oxic zone and 0.480. ±. 0.005 in the rhizosphere zone indicated preferential biodegradation of the S-enantiomer. Chloroacetanilide ethane sulfonic acid and oxanilic acid degradates were detected at low concentrations only (0.5. nM), suggesting extensive degradation and the operation of yet unknown pathways for chloroacetanilide degradation. Hydrochemical parameters and oxygen concentration were major drivers of bacterial composition, whereas exposure to chloroacetanilides had no detectable impact. Taken together, the results underline the importance of anaerobic degradation of chloroacetanilides in wetlands, and highlight the potential of complementary chemical and biological approaches to characterise processes involved in the environmental dissipation of chloroacetanilides. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

The project has been made possible by the Universidad de Oviedo's Energy, Environment and Climate Change Cluster, and was carried out at their facilities in Gijón (Asturias, Spain). To solve the differential equation, a common model for variations in surface temperature was used to describe the environmental conditions, and the temperatures recorded at various depths with the sensors were compared with the predictions set forth in the theoretical framework. Based on the results obtained so far, the method is believed to show encouraging results although difficulties were encountered in interpretation due to variations in water table level during the period of measurements.},

	abstract = {Upon completion of exploration and extraction of mineral resources, many mining sites have been abandoned without previously putting environmental protection measures in place. As a consequence, mine waters originating from such sites are discharged freely into surface water. Regional scale analyses were conducted to determine the hydrochemical characteristics of mine waters from abandoned sites featuring metal (Cu, Pb-Zn, Au, Fe, Sb, Mo, Bi, Hg) deposits, non-metallic minerals (coal, Mg, F, B) and uranium. The study included 80 mine water samples from 59 abandoned mining sites. Their cation composition was dominated by Ca2+, while the most common anions were found to be SO4 2- and HCO3 -. Strong correlations were established between the pH level and metal (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu) concentrations in the mine waters. Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to parameters generally indicative of pollution, such as pH, TDS, SO4 2-, Fe total, and As total. Following this approach, mine water samples were grouped into three main clusters and six subclusters, depending on their potential environmental impact. Principal component analysis was used to group together variables that share the same variance. The extracted principal components indicated that sulfide oxidation and weathering of silicate and carbonate rocks were the primary processes, while pH buffering, adsorption and ion exchange were secondary drivers of the chemical composition of the analyzed mine waters. Surface waters, which received the mine waters, were examined. Analysis showed increases of sulfate and metal concentrations and general degradation of surface water quality. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of water storage changes is crucial for Ethiopia, a country that is facing a range of challenges in water management caused by anthropogenic impacts as well as climate variability. In addition to this, the scarcity of in situ measurements of soil moisture and groundwater, combined with intrinsic "scale limitations" of traditional methods used in hydrological characterization are further limiting the ability to assess water resource distribution in the region. The primary objective of this study is therefore to apply remotely sensed and model data over Ethiopia in order to (i) test the performance of models and remotely sensed data in modeling water resources distribution in un-gauged arid regions of Ethiopia, (ii) analyze the inter-annual and seasonal variability as well as changes in total water storage (TWS) over Ethiopia, (iii) understand the relationship between TWS changes, rainfall, and soil moisture anomalies over the study region, and (iv) identify the relationship between the characteristics of aquifers and TWS changes. The data used in this study includes; monthly gravity field data from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and soil moisture from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model. Our investigation covers a period of 8. years from 2003 to 2011. The results of the study show that the western part and the north-eastern lowlands of Ethiopia experienced decrease in TWS water between 2003-2011, whereas all the other regions gained water during the study period. The impact of rainfall seasonality was also seen in the TWS changes. Applying the statistical method of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to TWS, soil moisture and rainfall variations indentified the dominant annual water variability in the western, north-western, northern, and central regions, and the dominant seasonal variability in the western, north-western, and the eastern regions. A correlation analysis between TWS and rainfall indicated a minimum time lag of zero to a maximum of six months, whereas no lag is noticeable between soil moisture anomalies and TWS changes. The delay response and correlation coefficient between rainfall and TWS appears to be related to recharge mechanisms, revealing that most regions of Ethiopia receive indirect recharge. Our results also show that the magnitude of TWS changes is higher in the western region and lower in the north-eastern region, and that the elevation influences soil moisture as well as TWS.},

	abstract = {Groundwater from karst aquifers is among the world's most important sources of drinking water supplies, and the hydrochemical characteristics of karst water are affected by both natural environment and people. Therefore, the study of karst groundwater hydrochemistry and its solutes' sources is very important to ensure the normal function of life support systems. In this paper, hydrogeochemistry and isotope hydrogeology approaches have been used to investigate the karst groundwater systems at Cheria region in recent years. Hydrochemical types of karst groundwater in the study area were mainly of the Ca-HCO3 type or Ca(Mg)-HCO3 type indicating that weathering of limestones and dolostones is the most important factor controlling the hydrogeochemistry of underground waters, and weathering of sulfate and evaporite rocks is less important. Moreover, the precipitation and human activities also have a definite influence on the hydrogeochemistry of underground waters in the region studied. Using stable isotope analysis data, δ18O and δ2H relationships show that all waters are meteoric in origin. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Hard rock aquifers are highly heterogeneous and hydrogeologically complex. To contribute to the design of hydrogeological conceptual models of hard rock aquifers, we propose a multi-techniques methodology based on a downward approach that combines remote sensing (RS), non-invasive hydrogeophysics and hydrogeological field data acquisition. The proposed methodology is particularly suitable for data scarce areas. It was applied in the pilot research area of Sardón catchment (80km2) located west of Salamanca (Spain). The area was selected because of hard-rock hydrogeology, semi-arid climate and scarcity of groundwater resources.The proposed methodology consisted of three main steps. First, we detected the main hydrogeological features at the catchment scale by processing: (i) a high resolution digital terrain model to map lineaments and to outline fault zones; and (ii) high-resolution, multispectral satellite QuickBird and WorldView-2 images to map the outcropping granite. Second, we characterized at the local scale the hydrogeological features identified at step one with: i) ground penetrating radar (GPR) to assess groundwater table depth complementing the available monitoring network data; ii) 2D electric resistivity tomography (ERT) and frequency domain electromagnetic (FDEM) to retrieve the hydrostratigraphy along selected survey transects; iii) magnetic resonance soundings (MRS) to retrieve the hydrostratigraphy and aquifer parameters at the selected survey sites. In the third step, we drilled 5 boreholes (25 to 48. m deep) and performed slug tests to verify the hydrogeophysical interpretation and to calibrate the MRS parameters. Finally, we compiled and integrated all acquired data to define the geometry and parameters of the Sardón aquifer at the catchment scale.In line with a general conceptual model of hard rock aquifers, we identified two main hydrostratigraphic layers: a saprolite layer and a fissured layer. Both layers were intersected and drained by fault zones that control the hydrogeology of the catchment. The spatial discontinuities of the saprolite layer were well defined by RS techniques while subsurface geometry and aquifer parameters by hydrogeophysics. The GPR method was able to detect shallow water table at depth between 1 and 3. m b.g.s. The hydrostratigraphy and parameterization of the fissured layer remained uncertain because ERT and FDEM geophysical methods were quantitatively not conclusive while MRS detectability was restricted by low volumetric water content. The proposed multi-technique methodology integrating cost efficient RS, hydrogeophysics and hydrogeological field investigations allowed us to characterize geometrically and parametrically the Sardón hard rock aquifer system, facilitating the design of hydrogeological conceptual model of the area.},

	abstract = {Maintaining the integrity of riparian ecosystems whilst continuing to reserve and extract water for other purposes necessitates a greater understanding of relationships between riparian vegetation and water availability. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a good indicator for identifying long-term changes in vegetated areas and their condition. In this study, we use regression tree analysis to investigate long term NDVI data (23 years) at semi-arid riparian areas in the Namoi catchment, Australia. Climatic factors (temperature and rainfall), surface water (flow and flooding) and groundwater levels are analysed collectively. We find that in general maximum temperature is the variable that primarily splits NDVI values, followed by antecedent 28-day rainfall and then inter-flood dry period and groundwater levels. More rain is required in the warmer months compared to cooler months to achieve similar mean NDVI values in tree patches or areas of high NDVI in riparian zones, presumably because of higher evaporation. Inter-flood dry period is shown to be important for maintenance of NDVI levels, particularly when rainfall is limited. Shallower groundwater levels sustain the NDVI and hence vegetation greenness when conditions are cooler and wetter.},

A two-dimensional (2D) resistivity survey of Chikotra basin, southern part of Kolhapur district in the Deccan Volcanic Province of Maharashtra was conducted. The aim of this work was to determine the aquifer zones of the study area using electrical resistivity imaging technique. The hydro-geological section derived from the available dug well/borehole lithology suggests that the top layer comprises red bole, laterite or black soil followed by weathered/fractured rock grading into compact basalts. The sources of groundwater appear to be available in weathered and fractured basalt trapped between weathered overburden and hard rock. Results from the 2D inverted models of resistivity variation with depth suggest the occurrence of aquifers mostly in weathered/fractured zones within the traps or beneath it. The resistivity models suggest that the northern part of the study area represents a promising aquifer zone with reasonable thickness of weathered basement. The models further indicate that there are several locations throughout the basin for possible groundwater exploration as it exhibited strong water-bearing potential in the subsurface rocks.},

Cluster analysis on 14 parameters has extracted three clusters. Cluster 1 (112 springs) is distinguished by normal temperatures, low TDS, EC, and high bicarbonate concentrations. Cluster 2 (five springs) has moderately high temperature, TDS, EC, and high concentration of chloride. Cluster 3 (two springs) exhibits high temperature, anomalous high TDS, EC, and chloride concentration. Three hydrogeological systems have been pictured based on the 3 clusters consecutively. The 1st system is developed in shallow unconfined aquifer, with domination of high bicarbonate (4.2\&\#xa0;me/L) meteoric water. The 2nd system is predominated with mixing processes, between groundwater in unconfined aquifer and hot groundwater from deeper aquifers. The 3rd system is primarily dominated by groundwater flow from deep formation. The hot – deep seated groundwater flow also carries mud particles. It has anomalous high \{TDS\} (\&gt;1000\&\#xa0;mg/L), \{EC\} (515\&\#xa0;μS/cm), and chloride (99\&\#xa0;me/L) from interaction between groundwater with clay formations, interpreted as Kaliwangu Formation.},

	abstract = {The south west coast of Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu, India, is significantly affected by seawater intrusion and diffusion of pollutants into the aquifers due to unregulated beach placer mining and other anthropogenic activities. The present study investigates the vulnerability of the coastal aquifers using Geographic Information System (GIS)-based DRASTIC model. The seven DRASTIC parameters have been analyzed using the statistical equation of this model to demarcate the vulnerable zones for aquifer contamination. The vulnerability index map is prepared from the weighted spatial parameters, and an accounting of total index value ranged from 85 to 213. Based on the categorization of vulnerability classes, the high vulnerable zones are found near the beach placer mining areas between Manavalakurichi and Kodimanal coastal stretches. The aquifers associated with settlements and agricultural lands in the middle–eastern part have experienced high vulnerability due to contaminated water bodies. Similarly, the coastal areas of Thengapattinam and Manakudi estuary and around the South Tamaraikulam have also been falling under high vulnerability condition due to backwater and saltpan. In general, the nearshore region except the placer mining zone and the backwater has a moderately vulnerable condition, and the vulnerability index values range from 149 to180. Significantly, the northern and northeastern uplands and some parts of deposition zones in the middle–south coast have been identified as low to no vulnerable conditions. They are structurally controlled by various geological features such as charnockite, garnet biotite gneiss and granites, and sand dunes, respectively. The aquifer vulnerability assessment has been cross-verified by geochemical indicators such as total dissolved solids (TDS), Cl−, HCO3 −, and Cl−/HCO3 − ratio. The high ranges of TDS (1,842––3,736 mg/l) and Cl− (1,412––2,112 mg/l) values are well correlated with the observed high vulnerable zones in the study area. The Cl−/HCO3 − ratio (7.13 to 12.18) of the high vulnerable zone obviously indicates deterioration of the aquifer contamination. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed to evaluate sensitivity of the individual DRASTIC parameters to aquifer vulnerability. This reveals the net recharge rate and groundwater table depth are becoming more sensitive to aquifer contamination. It is realized that the GIS is an effective platform for aquifer vulnerability mapping with reliable accuracy, and hence, the study is more useful for sustainable water resource management and the aquifer conservation.},

	abstract = {Characterisation of fractured rocks and evaluation of fracture connectivity are essential for the study of subsurface flow and transport in fractured rock aquifers. In this study, we use a new method to present fracture networks and analyse the connectivity of the fractures, based on the technique of randomly-generated realisations. The application of the method aims to provide more detailed insights into the flow path and dynamics for sustainable utilisation of groundwater in the Table Mountain Group (TMG) aquifers, South Africa. Focusing on a representative wellfield in the TMG, the interpretation and integration of fracture data derived from field measurements, existing geological maps and remotely-sensed imagery, and observed responses of hydraulic tests, led to the development of a conceptual model for fracture network characterisation, which forms the basis of fracture connectivity analysis. The result shows that the a dominant number of the interconnected fractures are in the form of separated fracture clusters (networks) which is considered to be a common connectivity pattern in the TMG rocks and alike. The result also suggests that the connectivity pattern is collectively dependent on such factors as orientation, length, and density of fractures and implies that in a study domain only a small part of the fractures are responsible for flow circulation.},

	abstract = {Satellite observations were used to test the validity of previously identified favourable conditions for the formation of freshwater lenses, identify additional potential occurrences, and model modern potential recharge in the Raudhatain Watershed (3696) in northern Kuwait. Favourable conditions include infrequent yet intensive precipitation events, drainage depressions to collect the limited runoff, and presence of conditions (e.g. high infiltration capacity) that promote groundwater recharge and preservation (e.g. underlying saline aquifer) of infiltrating groundwater as freshwater lenses floating over saline aquifer water due to differences in density. Specifically, the following field and satellite-based observations were noted for the Raudhatain Watershed: (1) Over 30 precipitation events were identified from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission precipitation data (1998-2009); (2) slope is gentle (2m/km), and the surface is largely (80\%) covered by alluvial deposits with high infiltration capacities (up to 9m/day); (3) no flows and long-term ponding were reported at the watershed outlet or detected from Landsat thematic mapper images; (4) infiltration is high based on increases in soil moisture content (from an advanced microwave scanning radiometer) and vegetation index following large precipitation events; and (5) freshwater lenses that overlie highly saline [total dissolved solids (TDS): \&gt;35000] unconfined aquifers underlying the watershed are absent in the southern regions, where infiltrating fresh water mixes with the less saline groundwater (TDS: \&lt;10000). Twenty potential locations (size: 1 to 75km2) for freshwater lens development were identified in northern Kuwait, and continuous rainfall-runoff models (Soil Water and Assessment Tool) were applied to provide a first-order estimation of the average annual recharge in the watershed (127×106m3) and freshwater lenses (8.17×106m3). Results demonstrate the settings for enhanced opportunities for groundwater recharge, outline the amounts of and preservation conditions for the groundwater feeding the freshwater lenses, and highlight potential applications and locations of freshwater lenses in similar settings elsewhere in the Arabian Peninsula and beyond. © 2013 John Wiley \&amp; Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to exploit potential application of an evidential belief function (EBF) model for spatial prediction of groundwater productivity at Langat basin area, Malaysia using geographic information system (GIS) technique. About 125 groundwater yield data were collected from well locations. Subsequently, the groundwater yield was divided into high (≥11m3/h) and low yields (\&lt;11m3/h) respectively, based on the groundwater classification standard recommended by Department of Mineral and Geosciences (JMG), Malaysia. Out of all of the borehole data, only 60 wells possessed higher yield at ≥ 11m3/h. Further, these wells were randomly divided into a testing dataset 70\% (42 wells) for training the model and the remaining 30\% (18 wells) was used for validation purpose. To perform cross validation, the frequency ratio (FR) approach was applied into remaining groundwater wells with low yield to show the spatial correlation between the low potential zones of groundwater productivity. A total of twelve groundwater conditioning factors that affect the storage of groundwater occurrences were derived from various data sources such as satellite based imagery, topographic maps and associated database. Those twelve groundwater conditioning factors are elevation, slope, curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), drainage density, lithology, lineament density, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil and rainfall. Subsequently, the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence model was applied to prepare the groundwater potential map. Finally, the result of groundwater potential map derived from belief map was validated using testing data. Furthermore, to compare the performance of the EBF result, logistic regression model was applied. The success-rate and prediction-rate curves were computed to estimate the efficiency of the employed EBF model compared to LR method. The validation results demonstrated that the success-rate for EBF and LR methods were 83\% and 82\% respectively. The area under the curve for prediction-rate of EBF and LR methods were calculated 78\% and 72\% respectively. The outputs achieved from the current research proved the efficiency of EBF in groundwater potential mapping. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We applied graphical methods and multivariate statistics to understand impacts of an unsewered slum catchment on nutrients and hydrochemistry of groundwater in Kampala, Uganda. Data were collected from 56 springs (groundwater), 22 surface water sites and 13 rain samples. Groundwater was acidic and dominated by Na, Cl and NO3. These ions were strongly correlated, indicating pollution originating from wastewater infiltration from on-site sanitation systems. Results also showed that rain, which was acidic, impacted on groundwater chemistry. Using Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified three distinct water quality groups. The first group had springs dominated by Ca-Cl-NO3, low values of electrical conductivity (EC), pH and cations, and relatively high NO3 values. These springs were shown to have originated from the acidic rains because their chemistry closely corresponded to ion concentrations that would occur from rainfall recharge, which was around 3.3 times concentrated by evaporation. The second group had springs dominated by Na-K-Cl-NO3 and Ca-Cl-NO3, low pH but with higher values of EC, NO3 and cations. We interpreted these as groundwater affected by both acid rain and infiltration of wastewater from urban areas. The third group had the highest EC values (average of 688μS/cm), low pH and very high concentrations of NO3 (average of 2.15mmol/l) and cations. Since these springs were all located in slum areas, we interpreted them as groundwater affected by infiltration of wastewater from poorly sanitized slums areas. Surface water was slightly reducing and eutrophic because of wastewater effluents, but the contribution of groundwater to nutrients in surface water was minimal because o-PO4 was absent, whereas NO3 was lost by denitification. Our findings suggest that groundwater chemistry in the catchment is strongly influenced by anthropogenic inputs derived from nitrogen-containing rains and domestic wastewater.},

	abstract = {Using a combination of multivariate statistical techniques and the graphical assessment of major ion ratios, the influences on hydrochemical variability of coal seam gas (or coal bed methane) groundwaters from several sites in the Surat and Clarence-Moreton basins in Queensland, Australia, were investigated. Several characteristic relationships between major ions were observed: 1) strong positive linear correlation between the Na/Cl and alkalinity/Cl ratios; 2) an exponentially decaying trend between the Na/Cl and Na/alkalinity ratios; 3) inverse linear relationships between increasing chloride concentrations and decreasing pH for high salinity groundwaters; and 4) high residual alkalinity for lower salinity waters, and an inverse relationship between decreasing residual alkalinity and increasing chloride concentrations for more saline waters. The interpretation of the hydrochemical data provides invaluable insights into the hydrochemical evolution of coal seam gas (CSG) groundwaters that considers both the source of major ions in coals and the influence of microbial activity. Elevated chloride and sodium concentrations in more saline groundwaters appear to be influenced by organic-bound chlorine held in the coal matrix; a sodium and chloride ion source that has largely been neglected in previous CSG groundwater studies. However, contrastingly high concentrations of bicarbonate in low salinity waters could not be explained, and are possibly associated with a number of different factors such as coal degradation, methanogenic processes, the evolution of high-bicarbonate NaHCO3 water types earlier on in the evolutionary pathway, and variability in gas reservoir characteristics. Using recently published data for CSG groundwaters in different basins, the characteristic major ion relationships identified for new data presented in this study were also observed in other CSG groundwaters from Australia, as well as for those in the Illinois Basin in the USA. This observation suggests that where coal maceral content and the dominant methanogenic pathway are similar, and where organic-bound chlorine is relatively abundant, distinct hydrochemical responses may be observed. Comparisons with published data of other NaHCO3 water types in non-CSG environments suggest that these characteristic major ion relationships described here can: i) serve as an indicator of potential CSG groundwaters in certain coal-bearing aquifers that contain methane; and ii) help in the development of strategic sampling programmes for CSG exploration and to monitor potential impacts of CSG activities on groundwater resources.},

The δD and δ18O values for hot water samples in the Khangai Mountain region vary from -87 to -126 ‰ and -12 to -17 ‰, respectively and are in good agreement with those of cold spring and river waters in the regions studied. The hot and cold spring waters in the Zavkhan region and at high altitude have more negative δD and δ18O values than those of other regions. There is no evidence of a δ18O shift. This means that all water samples come from meteoric water with minimal isotope exchange by interaction with surrounding rocks. The hot springs were of Na+-HCO3- and Na+-SO42- types whereas the cold springs and river waters were characterized as a Ca2+-HCO3- type water. The Ca2++Mg2+ concentrations in the cold springs and river waters are greatest in waters with elevated HCO3-. This shows that cold spring and river waters are enriched in Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3- due to dissolution of carbonate rocks such as dolomite commonly observed in the study area. In contrast, the hot springs are enriched in Na+ and K+ and depleted in Ca2+ by ion exchange with underlying clay minerals. The subsurface temperature calculated based on several geothermometer ranges from 75 to 140°C and thus the geothermal fields in the study area are classified as low temperature resources.},

	abstract = {Basic amenities such as clean water, air and food are essential not only for human livelihood but also for the surrounding biotic habitats in the environment for sustainable development. Due to the human habitation, and the anthropogenic activities, large scale change in land use has affected the hydrologic regime across watersheds. The water resource availability in a catchment depends upon the integrity of the land use, terrain and meteorological parameters such as rainfall, temperature, etc. The land use of the catchment plays an important role in maintaining the water flow in the rivers or streams as either surface or subsurface runoff (Pipeflow and Baseflow), holding water in the sub strata's, recharging the aquifers and hence catering the water demands as per the human and environmental needs. The study was conducted in order to understand the dynamics of land use and its implication on the catchment capabilities in catering the demands of environment (forests), agriculture, domestic and livestock needs on Lakshmanatirtha catchment of the Cauvery river basin which has an area of 3969 km2. The land use assessment using remote sensing and GIS showed the catchment is dominated (61.94\%) by agriculture and horticulture, followed by forests with as area of 14.3\% followed by other land uses. The Ghats (uplands) of the catchment is dominated by forests where as the plains are with agriculture and horticulture activities. Hydrologic assessment is done using the land use and the meteorological data was carried out at watershed level. The assessment showed that out of five watersheds, four of the watersheds had very high deficiency of water for over 3 months, and one of the watersheds had no deficit. The deficiency of water indicated that the watersheds were not able cater the both the human and environmental needs but also the streams were devoid of water flow which explains the deficiency in maintaining ecological flow.},

	abstract = {Urban streamflow is commonly characterized by increased peak discharges and runoff volumes. Slowflow integrates altered storage and transit times affecting urban recharge and drainage, resulting in a highly variable indeterminate urban slowflow response. This study introduces the use of multiple baseflow metrics to characterize and interpret the dominant processes driving urban slowflow response. Slowflow characteristics derived from USGS streamflow records are used to quantify the patterns of hydrologic alteration across the rural-to-urban landuse gradient in the Piedmont watersheds of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES), an NSF Urban Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in the Baltimore Metropolitan area. We interpret multimetric slowflow response from a top-down perspective, learning from data, in order to draw dominant process inferences from observed slowflow. When characterized by a single slowflow metric such as the baseflow index, urban slowflow response can exhibit equifinality and is not reliably predicted a priori. Multimetric analysis quantifies distinct differences in urban slowflow response, framing testable hypotheses and refined experimental designs to elucidate the dominant processes driving urban slowflow. Multimetric fingerprinting offers a consistent framework for interpreting urban slowflow response, constrained by the equifinality of single slowflow metrics and the inherent limitations on process inferences that can be drawn from gauged streamflow alone. Heterogeneity of observed slowflow belies the simple paradigm of a single consistent type of urban slowflow response. In contrast, we suggest a conceptual typology of urban slowflow response, framing a conceptual mixing model of dominant process endpoints that shape the slowflow fingerprints of urban hydrology. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Groundwater models which realistically represent the hydrogeology of a complex system, like the Unkheltseg Basin, are criticallyimportant to Mongolia. They have flow on benefits to research, governments, management strategies and commercial development within the country. Limited case studies of calibrated 3-D numerical transient simulations in fault-controlled connection between basins, similar to the Unkheltseg Basin, are available in the public domain and the model presented here aims to address this problem. This basin is uniquely geologically controlled and a key water supply resource for future economic development in the Taikh Valley. Commercial exploration projects have produced the high-quality geological and hydrogeological data gathered, necessary for successful model simulation at a basin-wide scale. Using the “DRAIN Package” and “Fracture-Well Package FW4” in MODFLOW-SURFACT, the spatial discretization necessary to fully represent horizontal and vertical flow direction was achieved to effectively constrain recharge and discharge across the fault barrier. This model is an important tool for establishing a long-term monitoring programme in a fault-controlled basin, which predicts regional impacts, both short and long term.},

	abstract = {Magmatic settings involving active volcanism are potential locations for economic geothermal systems due to the occurrence of high temperature and steam pressures. Indonesia, located along active plate margins, hosts more than 100 volcanoes and, therefore, belongs to the regions with the greatest geothermal potential worldwide. However, tropical conditions and steep terrain reduce the spectrum of applicable exploration methods, in particular in remote areas. In a case study from the Lamongan volcanic field in East Java, we combine field-based data on the regional structural geology, elemental and isotopic composition of thermal waters, and the mineralogical and geochemical signatures of volcanic rocks in exploring hidden geothermal systems. Results suggest infiltration of groundwater at the volcanoes and faults. After infiltration, water is heated and reacts with rocks before rising to the surface. The existence of a potential heat source is petrologically and geophysically constrained to be an active shallow mafic-magma chamber, but its occurrence is not properly reflected in the composition of the collected warmed spring waters that are predominantly meteoric in origin. In conclusion, spring temperature and hydrochemistry alone may not always correctly reflect the deep geothermal potential of an area. © 2015, Deon et al.},
